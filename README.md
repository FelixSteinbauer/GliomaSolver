## Software for realistic tumor modeling
_Tool for simulating tumor dynamics in patient-specific anatomy reconstructed from the medical scans._

#### Supported tumor models:
 * Tumor growth (Reaction-diffusion model)
 * Tumor mass effect and intracranial pressure (Brain deformation model)
 * Tumor hypoxia and necrosis
 * Bayesian model calibration for personalized radiotherapy planning 

#### Features:
 * **Fast execution** thanks to *highly-parallel architecture* and *adaptive grid refinement*
 * **User-friendly**; just provide patient anatomy and select the tumor model
 * **Developer-friendly**: the models are implemented as *modules*, which allows an *addition of new models* and a *combination* of the existing ones
 * **Transferable**: can be applied to other types of *infiltrative tumors* (e.g. multiple myeloma, liver lesions,...)
 * **Open source**, self-contained *C++ code*
 * Compatible with **Linux/Mac OS**
