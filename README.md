# Glioma solver
Solver for simulating tumor growth in a brain anatomy, including models for:
* tumor growth (Reaction-Diffusion model)
* tumor mass effect and intracranial pressure (Brain deformation model)
* others

### Instalations
* Required libaries: `tbb`, `vtk` and for deformation model also `hypre`
* Download the UNIX compatible libraries here: http://tdo.sk/~janka/lib/ 
* Unpack libraries and store to a folder, i.e. /lib/ 
* Install `tbb` libraries by calling ```make clean && make```
* `vtk` library is already precompiled, you just need to uncompressed it, no need to install
* For the deformation solver install also `hypre` (follow instructions in the hypre-2.10.0b)

### Set-up enviroment
In the following notes, files with a word *kraken* in the name refer to files for unix enviroment, while files with a word *lrz* in the name refer to SLURM cluster:
1) Set a path to your libraries either in your ```.bashrc``` or similar file or create set-up script. Folder ```makefile/``` contains two examples of setup scripts: ```setup_kraken.sh``` and ```setup_lrz.sh```. If using the example script, change ```LIB_BASE``` variabel to point to your libraries.
2) Create local makefile for your enviroment.  Folder ```makefile``` contains two examples of local makefiles ```make.kraken``` and ```make.lrz.sh```. 
    * Copy one of the example make file to ```make.your_host_name```, where *your_host_name* is your hostname, i.e. ```make.jana```. 
    * Inside your ```make.jana``` change ```LIB_BASE``` variabel to point to your libraries
3) Main ```Makefile``` calls corresponding local  ```make.* ``` file depending on the hostname. Modify it so it calls your  ```make.jana ```.

### Compilation & Running
Set up enviroment and compile:
```sh
source setup_kraken.sh
make clean && make -j 4
% For deformation model:
make clean && make helmholtz=hypre -j 4
```
Creates executable ```brain```. 

### Examples
Folder `Examples` contains example of solver:
* `TumorGrowth`: tumor growth model in patinet antomy using *reacion-diffusion model* as in [1]
* `BrainDeform`: mechanical model for tumor growth with mass effect using *brain-deformaiton model*
* `PatientInference`: Bayesian calibration of tumor growth model w.r.t. patient multimodal scans as proposed in [1]
