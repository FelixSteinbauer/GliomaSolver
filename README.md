# Glioma solver
Softer for simulating tumor growth in brain anatomy, including models:
* tumor growth (Reaction-Diffusion model)
* mechanical interaction of the growing tumor with the enviroment
* others

### Instalations
* downloaded the UNIX compatible libraries here: http://tdo.sk/~janka/lib/ 
* unpack libraries and store to a folder, i.e. /lib/ 
* install tbb libraries by calling ```make clean && make```
* vtk library is already precompiled, you just need to uncompressed it, no need to install

### Set-up enviroment
In following notes, files with a word *kraken* in the name refer to files for unix local computer, while files with a word *lrz* in the name refer to SLURM cluster files. Pick one, depending on your enviroment.
1) Set path to your libraries either in your ```.bashrc``` or similar file or create set-up script. Folder ```makefile/``` contains two examples of setup scripts: ```setup_kraken.sh``` and ```setup_lrz.sh```. If using the example script, change ```LIB_BASE``` variabel to point to your libraries.
2) Create local makefile for your enviroment.  Folder ```makefile``` contains two examples of local makefiles ```make.kraken``` and ```make.lrz.sh```. 
    * Copy one of the example make file to ```make.your_host_name```, where *your_host_name* is your hostname, i.e. ```make.jana```. 
    * Inside your ```make.jana``` change ```LIB_BASE``` variabel to point to your libraries
3) Main ```Makefile``` calls corresponding local  ```make.* ``` file depending on the hostname. Modify it so it calls your  ```make.jana ```.

### Compilation & Running
Set up enviroment, e.g. on the local computer called kraken. The compile:
```sh
source setup_kraken.sh
make clean && make -j 4
```
Creates executable ```brain```. 

### Example
Folder ```makefile/TumorGrowth``` contains script to run tumor growth in patient anatomy in the folder ```Anatomy```. To run it, copy your executable  ```brain``` inside the ```TumorGrowth```. To run the simulation on local unix computer:
```sh
./run.sh
```
To run on SLURM system:
```sh
bsub run.sh
```
